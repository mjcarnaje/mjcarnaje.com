## Introduction

The Catholic Church has long maintained teachings about spiritual protection and discernment regarding practices that may open doorways to extraordinary spiritual influences. The _Catholic Handbook of Deliverance Prayers_ (Revised Edition, Manila 2006), compiled by Fr. Jose Francisco C. Syquia for the Office of Exorcism of the Archdiocese of Manila, provides comprehensive guidance for Filipino Catholics navigating the intersection of folk religiosity and faith.

This article presents the "Checklist of the Occult and Esoteric" from this handbook, offering insights into practices the Church considers contrary to the First Commandment and potentially harmful to one's spiritual well-being.

## Understanding the Context

According to the handbook, while the list does not exhaust all occult practices in both Philippine folk religiosity and the New Age Movement, it presents many of the more common doorways by which the world of spirits (fallen angels) may enter in an extraordinary manner into the life of a Filipino Catholic.

The fundamental principle is clear: **As Catholics, we should never seek benefits from spiritual powers outside of God or open doorways by which evil spirits may attack us extraordinarily.**

## The First Commandment and Spiritual Practice

The practices and beliefs outlined go against, directly or indirectly, the First Commandment: "I am the Lord your God: you shall have no other gods before me." Purifying our Catholic faith not only pleases God but allows the fullness of God's graces, blessings, gifts, and protection to enter into our lives.

## Spiritual Protection Through Faith

The Catholic Church teaches that the best protection against spiritual harm comes through:

1. **Regular reception of the Sacraments** - Especially Confession and Holy Eucharist
2. **Prayer** - Personal and communal prayer life
3. **Sacred Scripture** - Reading and meditating on God's Word
4. **Devotions** - Rosary, Divine Mercy Chaplet, and other approved devotions
5. **Living according to Church teaching** - Following the moral and doctrinal guidance of the Church
6. **Seeking God alone** - Trusting in God's providence rather than spiritual powers outside His authority

## Conclusion

This comprehensive checklist serves as a tool for examining one's practices and beliefs in light of Catholic teaching. Rather than inducing fear, it aims to foster awareness and encourage Filipino Catholics to purify their faith, eliminate syncretistic practices, and trust more fully in God's grace and protection.

By avoiding practices that seek benefits from spiritual powers outside of God, Catholics open themselves more fully to authentic spiritual growth and the true peace that comes from relationship with Christ through His Church.
