description: "What started as a simple tool to help my sister manage her small food business has grown into Kita Tracker - a modern inventory management and business analytics platform built specifically for small food businesses in the Philippines. This is my personal startup project that I'm passionate about because I've seen firsthand how Filipino entrepreneurs struggle with tracking inventory, sales, and expenses. The platform combines a full POS system, real-time inventory tracking, and business analytics - all completely free because I believe every sari-sari store, carinderia, and small food business deserves access to professional tools. I'm on a mission to help more Filipino entrepreneurs succeed."

## The Story Behind Kita Tracker

This project holds a special place in my heart. It all started when I watched my sister struggle to manage her small food business. She was tracking everything in notebooks - inventory, sales, expenses - and often losing track of what was selling, what needed restocking, and whether she was actually making a profit.

I thought, "I'm a developer. I can build something to help her."

What began as a weekend project for my sister quickly revealed a bigger problem: **thousands of small food businesses across the Philippines face the same challenges**. Most inventory and POS systems are either too expensive, too complicated, or designed for larger enterprises.

## Why I Made It Free

After seeing how much Kita Tracker helped my sister's business, I knew I had to share it with others. But I also knew that the entrepreneurs who needed it most - the sari-sari store owners, the carinderia operators, the home-based food sellers - couldn't afford expensive software subscriptions.

So I made a decision: **Kita Tracker would be completely free**.

## What Kita Tracker Does

- **Inventory Management** - Track stock levels in real-time, get low-stock alerts, manage product variants
- **Point of Sale (POS)** - Fast, intuitive sales processing designed for busy food businesses
- **Business Analytics** - Understand your revenue, best-selling products, peak hours, and profit margins
- **Expense Tracking** - Keep track of all business expenses in one place
- **Customer Management** - Build relationships with repeat customers

## The Impact

Today, Kita Tracker serves **500+ small food businesses** across the Philippines, maintaining a **4.8/5 star rating** from users who finally have the tools they need to grow their businesses.

This isn't just a side project anymore - it's my startup, my mission, and my way of giving back to the community of hardworking Filipino entrepreneurs.
