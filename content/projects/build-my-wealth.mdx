order: 3
description: "As the Lead Mobile Developer & Co-Founder, I built Build My Wealth, a personal finance app featuring a sophisticated offline-first architecture with RxDB and bi-directional CouchDB synchronization. The app uses CRDT-based conflict resolution for eventual consistency, reactive data layer with observables for automatic UI updates, and fully offline-capable financial transaction workflows."
